# HCC Epic Creator

Create standardized UXD Epic tickets in Jira for the HCC team on the CPUX board. This skill handles the full workflow: gathering context, writing the problem statement, drafting the Definition of Done, and generating child stories.

## Prerequisites

- Atlassian MCP must be connected
- Cloud ID: `redhat.atlassian.net`
- Project key: `CPUX`

### HCC Board
- Board ID: `6195`
- Sprint naming pattern: `HCC Sprint N YYYY`
- To find the active sprint, search: `project = CPUX AND sprint in openSprints() AND component = HCC`

## Workflow

```
Epic Creation Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Gather epic details from user
- [ ] Step 2: Check for parent / linked tickets
- [ ] Step 3: Determine problem statement label
- [ ] Step 4: Write epic description (What + Problem Statement + Definition of Done)
- [ ] Step 5: Determine components, activity type, and story points
- [ ] Step 6: Create the epic in Jira
- [ ] Step 7: Generate and create child stories with sprint assignment
```

### Step 1: Gather Epic Details

Ask the user for:

1. **Epic name** — a short, descriptive name for the epic
2. **What is this epic about?** — the objective and expected deliverables
3. **Who is the target user?** — the user persona affected
4. **What is the problem?** — the specific issue or opportunity
5. **Do you have supporting data or evidence?** — analytics, research, user feedback, support tickets, competitive analysis, etc. If yes, collect source and metrics. If no, ask what the assumption is based on.
6. **What is the desired outcome / goal?** — what success looks like
7. **Who is the assignee?** — default to reporter/creator. Ask if there are additional contributors.

### Step 2: Check for Parent / Linked Tickets

Ask the user:
- **"Is there a parent Feature ticket (or another epic/story) on the PM side that this epic should be linked to?"**

If **yes — it's a Feature ticket**: set it as the epic's parent using the `parent` field during creation. Feature tickets sit above epics in the Jira hierarchy.

If **yes — it's another epic or story** (not a Feature): use `createIssueLink` after epic creation to link them. Use "Related" (`10077`) as the default link type, or "Depend" (`10076`) if there's a dependency.

If **no**: proceed without parent or links.

### Step 3: Determine Problem Statement Label

Based on the user's answers in Step 1, select **one** label:

| Label | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `problem-statement-uxd-data-driven` | Evidence from UX research: usability testing, surveys, user interviews, PWDR |
| `problem-statement-data-driven` | Evidence from non-UX sources: engineering metrics, PM analytics, support tickets, competitive analysis |
| `problem-statement-assumption` | No validated data; based on anecdotal feedback, team observations, hypotheses |
| `problem-statement-undefined` | No problem statement needed (rare edge case) |

**Present your recommendation with reasoning.** Let the user override if needed.

### Step 4: Write the Epic Description

Use markdown `contentFormat`. Structure:

**If data-driven** (`uxd-data-driven` or `data-driven`):

```
### What

[Describe the objective. What deliverable will be produced?]

### Problem Statement

[Target User] struggles with [specific issue]. Data from [source] shows [specific metrics]. This impacts [user goal/business goal].

### Definition of Done

This Epic should be Closed once the following criteria are met:

- The primary deliverable or artifact is attached or linked to this epic.
- The primary deliverable of this epic has been reviewed by stakeholders.
- All child tasks or stories within this epic have been closed or transferred to a follow-up epic. If a follow-up epic is created, a link to it has been added to this epic.
- If follow-up development work is needed, a link to it has been added to this epic.
- [Include any other criteria specific to this epic]
```

**If assumption-based**:

```
### What

[Describe the objective. What deliverable will be produced?]

### Problem Statement

We assume that [target user] experiences [specific issue] due to [reason]. This assumption is based on [source, e.g., limited feedback, prior knowledge].

### Definition of Done

(same structure as above)
```

For DoD tailoring, reference existing HCC epics: `project = CPUX AND issuetype = Epic AND component = HCC ORDER BY created DESC`

### Step 5: Determine Components, Activity Type, and Story Points

**Components**: Always include HCC (`68524`). Add Subscriptions (`68527`) if the topic matches: subscription, usage, billing, cloud integration, cost management, bundle, entitlement, renewal, committed spend, marketplace, pricing, license, quota, threshold, overage, on-demand.

**Activity Type** (`customfield_10464`):

| Phase | Option ID | Use when... |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Orient | `10317` | Early-stage opportunity identification, problem discovery, strategic planning |
| Explore | `10318` | Generating ideas, ideation, journey maps, user research, concept work |
| Make | `10319` | Finalizing design, prototyping, testing, iterating, detailed specs |
| Monitor | `10320` | Measuring outcomes, analytics review, post-launch evaluation |
| Enable | `10315` | Internal UXD team improvements, process changes, documentation |
| Consult | `10316` | Reactive work prompted by an external team, quick reviews |

**Story Points** (`customfield_10028`):

| Points | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| 1 | Extremely straightforward, very low effort, no risk |
| 2 | Straightforward, little risk, little investigation |
| 3 | Can be time consuming but fairly straightforward, some minor risks |
| 5 | Requires investigation, discussions, collaboration. Time consuming or complex |
| 8 | Big task, requires investigation + collaboration. Challenging solution. High risk |
| 13 | Too big — should be split into smaller epics |

### Step 6: Create the Epic in Jira

```json
{
  "cloudId": "redhat.atlassian.net",
  "projectKey": "CPUX",
  "issueTypeName": "Epic",
  "summary": "[UXD EPIC] <Epic Name>",
  "description": "<full markdown description from Step 4>",
  "assignee_account_id": "<looked up via lookupJiraAccountId>",
  "contentFormat": "markdown",
  "additional_fields": {
    "labels": ["<selected-problem-statement-label>"],
    "components": [{"id": "68524"}],
    "customfield_10464": {"id": "<activity-type-option-id>"},
    "customfield_10028": <story-points-number>
  }
}
```

If Subscriptions component is needed, add `{"id": "68527"}` to the components array.

If a **parent Feature** ticket exists, add: `"parent": "<FEATURE-KEY>"` at the top level of the createJiraIssue call.

If a **related epic/story** needs linking (not a Feature), use `createIssueLink` after creation:
```json
{
  "cloudId": "redhat.atlassian.net",
  "inwardIssue": "<RELATED-TICKET-KEY>",
  "outwardIssue": "<NEW-EPIC-KEY>",
  "type": "Related"
}
```

### Step 7: Generate Child Stories

Before creating stories, **find the active HCC sprint**:
```
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql: project = CPUX AND sprint in openSprints() AND component = HCC
```
Extract the sprint ID from `customfield_10020[0].id` in any result.

For each story, propose:

1. **Summary** — descriptive name
2. **Type** — Story (default), Task, or Spike
3. **Activity Type** — inherit from epic or set per-story if different
4. **Story Points** — using the scale from Step 5
5. **Components** — same as parent epic
6. **Sprint** — assign to the active HCC sprint
7. **Description** — using this format:

```
### What

[Describe what this story covers. Be specific about the deliverable and scope.]

### Definition of Done

This issue should be Closed once the following criteria are met.

- The primary deliverable or artifact is attached or linked to this issue.
- The primary deliverable of this issue has been shared for review with the UXD team members first, followed by the PM and Engineering teams (if appropriate).
- For UI-specific designs (aka things you make in Figma), the primary deliverable has been through a critique review session with at least one other designer.
- Follow-up tasks identified during the review have been created in the parent epic.
- [Include any other criteria specific to this story]
```

**Present the full story list to the user for review before creating.**

When creating stories:

```json
{
  "cloudId": "redhat.atlassian.net",
  "projectKey": "CPUX",
  "issueTypeName": "Story",
  "summary": "<story name>",
  "description": "<story description>",
  "parent": "<EPIC-KEY>",
  "assignee_account_id": "<user account id>",
  "contentFormat": "markdown",
  "additional_fields": {
    "components": [{"id": "68524"}],
    "customfield_10464": {"id": "<activity-type-option-id>"},
    "customfield_10028": <story-points-number>,
    "customfield_10020": <sprint-id-number>
  }
}
```

**Important**: Sprint ID must be a plain integer (e.g., `64782`), not an object.

## Important Notes

- Always present the full epic draft to the user for review before creating in Jira.
- Activity Type and Story Points must be set on **both** the epic and every child story.
- Stories should be assigned to the current active HCC sprint by default.
- The summary must always start with `[UXD EPIC]` followed by the epic name.
- For detailed guidance on problem statements, see [problem-statements.md](problem-statements.md).
- For the story point scale reference, see [story-points.md](story-points.md).
- For activity type definitions, see [activity-types.md](activity-types.md).
